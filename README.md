# Maze Solver using Depth-First Search in C++

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates depth-first search (DFS) for solving a maze. The maze is represented as a 2D array, where `1` represents walls and `0` represents open paths. The algorithm finds a path from the start `(1,1)` to the end `(8,8)` and prints the path taken.

## Features
- **Recursive DFS Maze Solver**: Explores paths recursively and backtracks when encountering dead ends.
- **Solution Path Output**: Prints the solution path if one is found.
- **Execution Time**: Measures the time taken to find a solution using the `chrono` library.
